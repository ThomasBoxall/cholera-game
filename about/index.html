        <div class="container">
            <p>Cholera Game is a game like Flappy Bird where rather than a bird, you play as a person avoid cholera. There's a <em>very specific</em> inside joke here. IYKYK.</p>
            <p>Developed on PC so probably doesn't work that well with touchscreens, sorry. Play with keyboard for the best cholera avoiding experience.</p>
            <p>Suggested soundtrack for the game: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Zbi0XmGtMw">We Like to Party! - Vengaboys</a>.</p>
            <p>Any issues, contact me a cholera@thomasboxall.net.</p>
